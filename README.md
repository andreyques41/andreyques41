# Andrey Quesada

**Software Engineer | Full-Stack Development & AI Workflows**

Building production-grade full-stack applications with AI-powered workflows. Recently completed intensive Full-Stack program (Lifter, 2025-2026) with 4+ production-quality projects. 6+ years prior experience at Intel building automation systems for silicon validation at scale.

## Recent Work (2025-2026)

Built complete applications from scratch demonstrating modern software engineering:

| Project | Description | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [**CaterPro**](https://github.com/andreyques41/caterpro) | Full-stack catering platform with 60 endpoints, 85% test coverage | Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT, Vanilla JS |
| [**Multi-Agent Web Dev**](https://github.com/andreyques41/multi-agent-web-dev) | AI-powered workflow with 6 specialized agents | Python, CrewAI, LLMs |
| [**Pet E-commerce API**](https://github.com/andreyques41/pet-ecommerce-api) | RESTful API with 42 endpoints, 78% test coverage | Flask, PostgreSQL, JWT Auth |
| [**Todo List App**](https://github.com/andreyques41/todo-list-app) | Modular frontend with MVC architecture | HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Vite |
| [**Software Engineering Lab**](https://github.com/andreyques41/software-engineering-lab) | Data structures, algorithms, SQL, GUI app | Python, SQL, Testing |

## What I Build

**Full-Stack Applications**
- End-to-end ownership: frontend (JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Vite) + backend (Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- RESTful APIs with layered architecture (controllers → services → repositories)
- JWT authentication & role-based access control
- Database design, optimization, and caching strategies
- Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)

**AI Workflows**
- Multi-agent systems with CrewAI for automated development
- LLM orchestration and prompt engineering
- Automated code generation and documentation
- Strategic AI integration in production environments

**Production Engineering**
- Security best practices from Intel production environments
- Scalable architectures and performance optimization
- Test-driven development with high coverage
- Clean code principles and maintainable systems

## Intel Experience (2018-2025)

Production automation for silicon validation:
- **2×** reduction in critical validation timelines
- **30%** test time reduction (hundreds of thousands USD saved)
- **3×** faster data analysis through pipeline automation
- Led teams of 3-4 engineers on production systems
- Applied AI agents and LLMs to accelerate test creation and validation automation, integrating outputs into production workflows

Technologies: Python, C#, SQL, Linux, data pipelines, test automation

---

## Currently

Focused on **Backend Systems Engineer** roles where I can:
- Design scalable backend architectures and production APIs
- Integrate AI as an engineering multiplier rather than a gimmick
- Apply production‑grade standards to modern web development
- Deliver maintainable, well‑tested systems that scale
